## Known issues
https://github.com/BogRtM/Pathfinder/issues

Due to the fact that summons are controlled by the server in multiplayer, it is highly recommended that the Pathfinder player be the host, otherwise there will be latency in commanding Squall.

## Important

I do not own the SotS DLC; if there are any bugs or incompatabilities with the new DLC content, then I am not aware of them.

# The Pathfinder 
The Pathfinder is a glass cannon melee survivor who commands a robotic falcon, Squall. Together, they can dish out tremendous DPS, and take down any game.

• Squall can be commanded to focus on selected enemies, or return to you when necessary.<br/>
• Unlike other melee survivors, you have low HP and no armor; poke from afar when necessary and choose your engagements wisely.<br/>
• The Pathfinder prefers items that increase his burst damage potential, while Squall benefits greatly from attack speed and critical chance.<br/>
• Lysate Cell is highly recommended!

This survivor was inspired by Insect Glaive from Monster Hunter, and Rexxar from the Warcraft series.
