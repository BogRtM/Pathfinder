## News

I'm really really *REALLY* sorry that it took this long for an update. In particular I would like to greatly apologize to Mr. Bones, for taking so long to implement the mastery skin.

Pathfinder isn't dead; I have just been slacking greatly. I intend to finish him entirety within the next couple of months.

## Known issues
https://github.com/BogRtM/Pathfinder/issues

Due to the fact that summons are controlled by the server in multiplayer, it is highly recommended that the Pathfinder player be the host, otherwise there will be latency in commanding Squall.

# The Pathfinder 
The Pathfinder is a glass cannon melee survivor who commands a robotic falcon, Squall. Together, they can dish out tremendous DPS, and take down any game!

• Squall can be commanded to focus on selected enemies, or return to you when necessary.<br/>
• Unlike other melee survivors, you have low HP and no armor; poke from afar when necessary and choose your engagements wisely.<br/>
• The Pathfinder prefers items that increase his burst damage potential, while Squall benefits greatly from attack speed and critical chance.<br/>
• Lysate Cell is highly recommended!

This survivor was inspired by Insect Glaive from Monster Hunter, and Rexxar from the Warcraft series.

## Important
This is an early access, alpha release of a WIP survivor. He is still incomplete, and in active development. As such, please understand that he may be buggy, and that many things are still liable to change for the 1.0 release, even his gameplay and kit design. My intent on releasing him as he is now is to find bugs and to gather external feedback. Please feel free to contact `Bog#4770` on discord with bug reports or feedback. For now, a config file has been provided for you to play around with *some* of his values.

## Change Log

### Latest Patch

`0.4.0`
```
• Added Mastery skin

• Squall's missile launcher is back to firing projectiles instead of orbs
    - The orb missiles had poor synergy with Backup Mags, so I am reverting the change.
    
• Fleetfoot's dash distance will now receive diminishing returns from movement speed
    - To compensate, the base distance has been increased.
    - This will result in a greater dash distance at below ~185% movement speed, and lower distance at greater values.
    
• Rending Talons default cooldown reduced from 8 to 6 seconds.
    
• Rending Talons now grants a movement speed buff and 100% air control while airborne.

• Added a VFX trail to Rending Talons to better reflect its hitbox.
    - This is a temporary measure while I work on real VFX.
    - But I might just keep it as is.
```
