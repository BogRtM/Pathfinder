## Early Access - Alpha Release
### **DISCLAIMER : NOT A SINGLE THING HAS BEEN TESTED IN MULTIPLAYER**
Whether or not it works in multiplayer, I do not know. Your feedback will be crucial in finding bugs and incompatibilities.

# The Pathfinder 
The Pathfinder is a glass cannon spear hunter who commands a robotic falcon, Squall. Together, they can dish out tremendous DPS, and take down any game!

• Squall can be commanded to focus on selected enemies, or return to you when necessary.<br/>
• Unlike other melee survivors, you have low HP and no armor; poke from afar when necessary and choose your engagements wisely.<br/>
• The Pathfinder benefits from items that increase his burst damage potential, while Squall benefits greatly from attack speed and critical chance.
• Lysate Cell is highly recommended!

This survivor was inspired by Insect Glaive from Monster Hunter, and Rexxar from the Warcraft series.

## Important
This is an early access, alpha release of a WIP survivor. He is still incomplete, and in active development. As such, please understand that he may be buggy, and that many things are still liable to change for the 1.0 release, even his gameplay and kit design. My intent on releasing him as he is now is to find bugs and to gather external feedback. Please feel free to contact `Bog#4770` on discord with bug reports or feedback. For now, a config file has been provided for you to play around with *some* of his values.

If you have advice or suggestions on how to improve my code, please reach out to me.
