## !!! NOT A SINGLE THING HAS BEEN TESTED IN MULTIPLAYER !!!
Whether or not it works in multiplayer, I do not know. Your feedback will be crucial in finding bugs and incompatibilities.

# The Pathfinder 
The Pathfinder is a glass cannon melee survivor who commands a robotic falcon, Squall. Together, they can dish out tremendous DPS, and hunt down any game!

## Important
This is an early access, alpha release of a WIP survivor. He is still in active development, and as such, please understand that he may be buggy, and that many things are still liable to change for the 1.0 release. My intent on releasing him as he is now is to find bugs and to gather external feedback. Please feel free to contact **Bog#4770** on discord with bug reports or feedback.
